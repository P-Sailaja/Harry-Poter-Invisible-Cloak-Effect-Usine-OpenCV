## Harry Potter Invisible Cloak Effect (OpenCV Project)
### Project Overview

Ever dreamed of owning Harry Potterâ€™s Invisibility Cloak?
ðŸª„This project recreates that magical effect using Python & OpenCV by leveraging color detection and image masking techniques.

When a person wears a cloak of a specific color (e.g., red/green/blue), the program identifies that color in the video stream and replaces it with the background, making the cloak â€” and the person wearing it â€” appear invisible!

### ðŸŽ¥ How It Works

**1.** Capture the background frame at the start.

**2.** Continuously capture frames from the webcam.

**3.** Convert each frame from BGR â†’ HSV color space for better color detection.

**4.** Apply color thresholding to detect the cloakâ€™s color.

**5.** Use masking and bitwise operations to replace the cloak area with the background.

**6.** Display the final frame where the cloak looks invisible.
